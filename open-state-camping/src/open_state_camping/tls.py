"""Shared TLS trust configuration for outbound HTTPS.

By default httpx verifies certificates against certifi's bundle, which ignores a
corporate or proxy CA installed in the **system** trust store. Many operators
(and this project's own remote test environment) run behind a TLS-intercepting
egress proxy, so a certifi-only client fails with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED even
though the host is reachable.

`verify_setting()` returns an httpx ``verify`` value that honors the system trust
store and the standard CA environment variables, while still falling back to
certifi everywhere else. It is portable: on a normal machine with no proxy it
behaves exactly like the httpx default. We never *disable* verification - that
would expose the citizen to interception (Constitution Art. 1 spirit); we only
broaden the set of CAs we trust to include ones the operator has installed.
